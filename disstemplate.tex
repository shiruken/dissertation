\topmargin 0.125in	% Adjust this value if the PostScript file output
			% of your dissertation has incorrect top and
			% bottom margins. Print a copy of at least one
			% full page of your dissertation (not the first
			% page of a chapter) and measure the top and
			% bottom margins with a ruler. You must have
			% a top margin of 1.5" and a bottom margin of
			% at least 1.25". The page numbers must be at
			% least 1.00" from the bottom of the page.
			% If the margins are not correct, adjust this
			% value accordingly and re-compile and print again.
			%
			% The default value is 0.125"

		% If you want to adjust other margins, they are in the
		% utdiss2-nn.sty file near the top. If you are using
		% the shell script Makediss on a Unix/Linux system, make
		% your changes in the utdiss2-nn.sty file instead of
		% utdiss2.sty because Makediss will overwrite any changes
		% made to utdiss2.sty.

\utabstract
\indent
This document has the form of a ``fake'' doctoral dissertation in order to provide an example of such, but it is actually a
copy of Miguel Lerma's documentation for the Mathematics Department Computer Seminar of 25 March 1998 updated in July 2001
and following by Craig McCluskey to meet the March 2001 requirements of the Graduate School.
