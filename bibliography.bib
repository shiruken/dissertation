Paper presents system using the phosphorescence quenching of lumiphores to measure oxygen concentrations in tissue (very limited, must be placed into cuvette)


IN MAMMALIAN TISSUES, OXYGEN MUST be continuously supplied to maintain cellular homeostasis. Even moderate reductions of blood flow compromise physiological function. In order to investigate the nature of oxygen supply to tissue in detail, a method is needed for the accurate measurement of the concentration of oxygen at its site of transfer from the vascular bed to parenchymal cells. Methods that have been used to assess tissue oxygenation not only have individual technical problems but in general are weakened by their inflexibility. For example, oxygen microelectrodes are not always suitable because (i) they are restricted to specific locations within the tissue, thereby preventing evaluation of a large area, and (ii) they must be inserted into the tissue, which disturbs its local environment.

Recently we developed a method for measuring oxygen that is based on its ability to quench phosphorescence of selected lumiphores. This method is accurate and provides precise serial measurements of oxygen in the physiological range, from 10^-3 M to less than 10^-8 M. To date, however, this methodology has been restricted to the in vitro study of biological samples that can be placed in a cuvette, such as suspensions of isolated mitochondria and cells. We have shown that phosphorescence measurements can be used to obtain images of oxygen distribution in tissue without invasion of that tissue. Inhomogeneities of oxygen delivery to tissue of isolated perfused rat liver have been demonstrated with a video camera, which detects the phosphorescence of palladium (Pd)-coproporphyrin in the tissue perfusate.

When the tissue is illuminated, some light is absorbed by the Pd-coproporphyrin, which excites it to the triplet state. The triplet state returns to the ground stte either by light emission or by energy transfer to other molecules (quenching). In biological materials, the principal quenching agent is oxygen and this quenching is diffusion limited. The effect on phosphorescence is described by the Stern-Volmer relation: I.sub.0./I = [tau].sub.0./[tau] = 1 + k.sub.q.[tau].sub.0.[O.sub.2] where I.sub.0 and [tau].sub.0 are the phosphorescence intensity and lifetime, respectively, in the absence of oxygen; I and [tau] are the phosphorescence intensity and lifetime, respectively, at a given oxygen concentration [O.sub.2.]; and k.sub.q is a constant related to the rates of diffusion of oxygen and the selected lumiphore. The Stern-Volmer relation is accurately obeyed for the quenching of the phosphorescence of Pd-coproporphyrin by oxygen. This relation can be used to calculate the concentration of oxygen from the intensity of the emitted light or from the lifetime of the triplet state.

After fasted (24 hours) male Sprague-Dawley rats (275 to 325 g) had been anesthetized, the livers were perfused in situ via the portal vein with Krebs-Henseleit buffer supplemented with 5 mM glucose. The buffer was maintained at 37[deg.]C and equilibrated with 95% O.sub.2:5% CO.sub.2 (v:v) by mild bubbling. In addition, the influent was passed through gas-permeable Silastic tubing (60 cm long, 2mm in internal diameter) placed within Tygon tubing (3.5 mm in internal diameter) through which the same gas mixture flowed. During this single-pass perfusion period, the liver was surgically removed from the body and placed in a clear plastic petri dish positioned on a tripod from which the tissue was illuminated from below. A xenon arc lamp was placed about 12 cm from a mirror positioned under the liver. The collimated light was reflected upward by the mirror to the surface of the liver where it illuminated a circular area 3 to 4 cm in diameter. Phosphorescence emission ({\&}gt;665 nm, with the use of a Schott cutoff filter) from the illuminated area was reflected to a silicon intensified target (SIT) video camera (Dage MTI model 66, Michigan City, Indiana) by a second mirror positioned beneath the liver. The video camera, placed approximately 0.25 m from the latter mirror, imaged the liver through a 90-mm lens. The camera output was continuously displayed on a monitor and recorded by a video cassette recorder.

The Pd-coproporphyrin (1 [mu]M) was added to Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin (Fraction V, ICN Immunobiologicals, Lisle, Illinois) and recirculated for 5 to 10 min before data acquisition and then for the remainder of the experiment. Pd-coproporphyrin was chosen as the oxygen probe because it remained in...}

Phosphorescent probes -{\&}gt; excited to triplet state -{\&}gt; emit light or transfer energy to other molecule and return to ground state (quenched)

As long as the delivery of quencher molecule is not rate-limiting step (e.g. high quencher concentration) then simple exponential can describe the relationship I = Io * exp(-t/$\tau$)

1/$\tau$ = 1/$\tau$o + kq[Q]       {\&}lt;-- Stern Volmer Relationship

1/$\tau$o = k1 (characteristic lifetime of the phosphorescence decay in absence of quencher)

kq = frequency of collision between triplet state probe molecules and quencher (second order rate constant)

Fitting data vector to single exponential curve = assumes sample homogeneity

Exponential Series Method (ESM) and Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) applied in analysis of fluorescence decay data collected from heterogeneous samples
	- ESM is faster and requires lesser computational resources

Based on modulation of a high-frequency pulsed laser by a signal synchronous with the pixel clock of the scanner and recording the fluorescence and phosphorescence signals by multi-dimensional TCSPC where fluorescence is recorded during the on-phase of the laser and phosphorescence is recorded during the off-phase

Does not require a reduction in the laser pulse repetition rate and eliminates the need of using excessively high pulse power for phosphorescence excitation

Biologically useful to record both fluorescence and phosphorescence lifetimes

Phosphorescence requires an excitation pulse period longer than the luminescence lifetime (difficult to achieve such low repetition rates with a pulsed laser of a scanning laser microscope)

Reduction in repetition rate leads to a reduction in average excitation power (for a given pulse power) and requires an increase in pulse power to compensate (problematic, saturation, nonlinearity)

Any sample that emits phosphorescence also fluorescences (lifetimes of a few nanoseconds) and an increase in excitation power results in increase in fluorescence peak power that can lead to detector saturation such that phosphorescence signal might be missed during the overload recovery time

High-frequency pulsed laser is used to excite for a short period of time at the beginning of each pixel. During the on-time, the laser excites fluorescence and builds up phosphorescence. During the off-time, pure phosphorescence is obtained. This requires synchronization with the pixel clock}

PET and fMRI are most common neuroimaging modalities but are limited in spatiotemporal resolution and effectiveness of calibration, respectively

Measurement of pO2 based on oxygen-based quenching of phosphorescence should not be affected by optical parameters of tissue and provide an absolute measurement of pO2

Presents instrumentation combining phosphorescence lifetime imaging with laser speckle contrast imaging to achieve high-speed wide-field images of pO2 and rCBR.

Produces simultaneous 2D maps of absolute pO2 value (via phosphorescence lifetime imaging) in brain vasculature and rCBF (via laser speckle contrast imaging)

Combines laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) with intrinsic optical signal imaging (IOSI) to quantify flow speeds and blood oxygenation

Optical systems allow high spatial and temporal resolution with inexpensive equipment

Multimodal system allows for insight into the hemodynamic response and neurovascular coupling

Existing systems do not represent normal behavior from animal models because animal movement will interfere with measurements. The effects of anesthesia on hemodynamic responses has imaged and therefore a portable, real-time imaging system that allows for normal animal behavior while fully conscious is desirable.

LSCI requires highly coherent laser source to produce the speckle pattern needed to measure flow

IOSI needs low coherence, wider spectrum source to produce low-noise illumination needed to measure small fluctuations in reflectance (incoherent LED commonly used cannot be used for LSCI)

"Line scan" spatiotemporal correlation technique can be used to track individual cell motion in vessels and directly quantify speeds
	Computationally intensive
	Requires very high frame rates
	Only examine a single small ROI

Developed a system using coherence control of Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) to produce illumination satisfying the needs of both the IOSI and LSCI from a single source in a specialized current sweep (SW) operation scheme
	Near threshold, the device produces highly coherent, single mode laser illumination
	Modulating the current broadens the effective spectrum by taking advantage of thermal effects within the laser cavity to broaden the spectrum and reducing coherence

VCSEL offers greater power efficiency than LEDs (e.g. LED produces 5-10mW output with 200mW input while a VSCEL produces 2-5mW with only 10-20mW input)

LEDs require notch filtering to "narrow down" the spectrum if accurate results are desired

VCSEL achieve thermal stability within microseconds, while edge emitting lasers require longer warmup before both stable wavelength and power is achieved (VSCEL allows for pulsing)

Claim that averaging superimposed speckles allows for reduction of speckle noise using current sweep spectral broadening in VCSELs
	Reducing the coherence length, increases number of speckles seen, which leads to decrease in speckle contrast and suitability for IOSI functionality

Used three current swept VCSELs at 680, 795, and 850nm to match Hb spectra
	Characterized using optical spectrum analyzer and interferometry
	Spectra measured at threshold current, at peak power, and during current sweeping
	Current sweeping spectral widths were used to estimate the coherence lengths
	Reduced coherence was confirmed using a Michelson interferometer}

Highly specific - Oxygen is the only small-molecule dynamic quencher present in sufficiently high concentration to result in quenching

Stern-Volmer Model: 1/$\tau$  = 1/$\tau$0 + (kq)*(pO2)
	$\tau$ = phosphorescence lifetime at a specific oxygen pressure pO2 (measured by device)
	$\tau$0 = phosphorescence lifetime in the absence of oxygen (measured at pO2 = 0)
	kq = quenching constant (obtained from literature)

Polyglutamic dendritic porphyrins (Oxyphor R2 and G2) offered partial solution to foreign albumin toxicity (previously required to enhance aqueous solubility) 

Oxyphor R2 and G2 still depend upon albumin-rich environments, otherwise erroneous signal

Oxyphor R4 and G4 created by encapsulating inside hydrophobic dendrimers and then peripheral PEGylation is used to ensure high aqueous solubility and prevents the porphyrins from interacting with biological macromolecules. 

Dynamic phosphorescence measurements were conducted with a phosphorometer (time-domain)

Phosphorescence lifetime imaging was conducted using a wide-field macroscope system (8-bit ICCD camera with internal intensifier with macrozoom lens and long-pass filter) with an LED light source (635nm) (time-domain)

Oxyphor R4 and G4 are dependent upon the temperature but independent of the pH and found to be stable without aggregation at concentrations up to 10^-4 M. They also function independent of the albumin concentration and are stable for long periods of storage. 

pO2 of normal muscle and tumor tissue was found to be dependent upon the amount of anesthesia (high levels of isofluorane led to abrupt decreases in tissue pO2).

Uses a DMD to selectively illuminate arbitrary shaped regions of tissue in order to retain high temporal resolution by using a PMT

Phosphorescence quenching methods are almost always limited to a single spatial location and only a few have actually produced spatial maps. 
	These typically required either scanning lasers or extremely sensitive cameras with gated 	exposure times - take longer to acquire because of scanning and/or require much averaging 	to achieve desired SNR

LSCI - 808nm 30mW laser diode at 45{\textdegree} angle 20cm away from animal, CMOS camera (Basler) at 100fps and 5ms exposure time

pO2 - 532nm laser light, gated with acoustic optical modulator, 10{\textmu}s pulses @ 1kHz, passes through two 700nm bandpass filters before being collected by PMT, Oxyphor R2

Induced ischemia with topical ET-1 (vasoconstricting agent) and photothrombotic production of singlet oxygen from Oxyphor R2 excited by higher energy light targeted by the DMD
	 - Cannot image and cause photothrombosis at the same time
