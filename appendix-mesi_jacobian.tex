\chapter{Jacobian Matrix of the MESI Equation}

The Jacobian matrix ($\bm{J}$) is the matrix of all first-order partial derivatives of a vector-valued function ($\bm{f}$):

\begin{equation}
    \bm{J} = \left[\frac{\partial \bm{f}}{\partial x_1} \ldots \frac{\partial \bm{f}}{\partial x_n}\right]
\end{equation}
