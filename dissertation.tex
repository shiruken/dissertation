\topmargin 0.125in	% Adjust this value if the PostScript file output
			% of your dissertation has incorrect top and
			% bottom margins. Print a copy of at least one
			% full page of your dissertation (not the first
			% page of a chapter) and measure the top and
			% bottom margins with a ruler. You must have
			% a top margin of 1.5" and a bottom margin of
			% at least 1.25". The page numbers must be at
			% least 1.00" from the bottom of the page.
			% If the margins are not correct, adjust this
			% value accordingly and re-compile and print again.

			% The default value is 0.125"

		% If you want to adjust other margins, they are in the
		% utdiss2-nn.sty file near the top. If you are using
		% the shell script Makediss on a Unix/Linux system, make
		% your changes in the utdiss2-nn.sty file instead of
		% utdiss2.sty because Makediss will overwrite any changes
		% made to utdiss2.sty.
